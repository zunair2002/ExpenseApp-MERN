# Expense Tracker - MERN Stack Application

This is a dynamic, full-stack expense tracker application built from the ground up using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The backend, powered by a Node.js and Express server, exposes a RESTful API to handle all business logic, while the frontend is a responsive Mutiple-Page Application (MPA) built with React for a fast and interactive user interface. It allows users to securely register for an account, log in with authentication **(Local storage)**, and subsequently manage their finances by tracking their daily income and expenses in real-time.
